# Sentiment Analysis of Financial News using NLTK

The project performed sentiment analysis on financial news articles using the NLTK library. Various models, including Logistic regression, SVM, XGBoost, KNN, and Random Forest, were employed for sentiment classification. Hyperparameter tuning techniques were applied to optimize accuracy. The project successfully implemented sentiment analysis, accurately classifying sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral based on the textual content. Linear support vector machine models yielded the best results overall.
